# Reformatter

Reformatter methods facilitate the conversion of a quadrille into various formats, including [BigInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt), [images](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Image), and array data structures. These transformations allow seamless transitions and interoperability between different data representations.
