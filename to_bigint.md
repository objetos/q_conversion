title: toBigInt(littleEndian?)
---

Returns a [bitboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitboard)—encoded as a JavaScript [BigInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt)—that represents the filled cells of the quadrille.

Each `1` bit marks a filled cell and `0` an empty one. Cells are encoded in **row-major** order, and by default, use **big-endian** layout (top-left cell is the most significant bit). Round-trips faithfully with [createQuadrille(width, height, bitboard, value)]({{< relref "create_quadrille_width_height_bigint_value" >}}) — the backbone of the `maze` → `toBigInt` → `const` level pipeline (see [maze]({{< relref "maze" >}})). The height-deriving [createQuadrille(width, bitboard, value)]({{< relref "create_quadrille_width_bigint_value" >}}) form infers rows from the bit length instead, so leading empty cells shorten the decode: whenever the whole top row is empty, a row drops and the pattern shifts. Pass both dimensions to decode stored levels — a maze's `(0, 0)` is always open, so its bitboard always starts with a `0` bit.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Use `littleEndian = true` to reverse the bit order, so the top-left cell becomes the least significant bit. This is common in some chess engines and low-level systems.
